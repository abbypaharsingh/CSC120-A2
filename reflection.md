What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
   Taking things step by step and using the rubric helped because at first I felt really overwhelmed and confused about where to start or what to do. I was also confused about running and testing the program. Going to TA hours really helped me polish my code and figure out the technical things I didn't know how to do.
